Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.

See gittutorial(7) to get started, then see Everyday Git[1] for a useful minimum set of commands. The Git Userâ€™s Manual[2] has a more in-depth introduction.

After you mastered the basic concepts, you can come back to this page to learn what commands Git offers. You can learn more about individual Git commands with "git help command". gitcli(7) manual page gives you an overview of the command line command syntax.
